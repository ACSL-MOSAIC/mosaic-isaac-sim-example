# Mosaic Isaac Sim Example

## Overview

This project/repository provides an example of applying the [mosaic system](https://github.com/ACSL-MOSAIC/mosaic-core.git) to an Isaac Lab-based project.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
  We recommend using the conda or uv installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone or copy this project/repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ACSL-MOSAIC/mosaic-isaac-sim-example.git
    ```
  
- Install the [mosaic-core](https://github.com/ACSL-MOSAIC/mosaic-core.git) library by following the instructions in its README.
- After building the `mosaic-core` library, with a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:
    ```bash
    # use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
    python -m pip install -e mosaic-core/build/python
    ```

## Setup Mosaic Configuration yaml File
- Create a mosaic configuration yaml file based on your requirements.

## Running the Example
- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, run h1_locomotion.py

    ```bash
    # use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
    python scripts/h1_locomotion.py
    ```
  
## Code formatting

We have a pre-commit template to automatically format your code, which is automatically generated by Isaac Lab.
To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
